Useful modules:   
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org): Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.   
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org): DescriptionTensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning developed by Google Brain Team.   
- [PyTorch](https://ai.facebook.com/tools/pytorch/): is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR).   
- [Keras](https://keras.io): A Python deep learning API. DescriptionKeras is an open-source library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library.   

- [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai): fastai is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. fastai is basically another layer on top of PyTorch that gives you a lot new functionality around your neural network, such as visualization methods for your data, more ways of loading and splitting data, infering the number of classes from the dataset your provide and it extends the training utilities by a concept called "callbacks" (which keras also has but pytorch doesn't).   

- [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit): Develop, Optimize and Deploy GPU-Accelerated Apps   
- [CuPy](https://cupy.dev): A NumPy-compatible array library accelerated by CUDA    

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com): is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. FastAPI is properly fast when we compare it to other major Python frameworks like Flask and Django.   

- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev): Selenium automates browsers.    







- [pyenv:](https://github.com/su6i/python/blob/master/pyenv.txt) A good tool to manage all Python versions and Virtual environments that you need on your machine!
